# Chipper

### Chipper is a micro state-management tool aimed at perfect (for me 🤡 ) developer experience and idiot-proof 🙈 🙉 🙊 (because I need it) API.<br>

### Chipper is my personal experiment. I needed to learn about classes and observables. Context API has been great for me in all my personal projects, but using observables solves more problems.

# Wat? 🗿

- minimal setup
- written with TS
- no excess re-renders
- react and react-native friendly
- [immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction) is used somewhere inside (easier that way) 🎉
- built-in capabilities for handling status of async functions
- almost framework-agnostic (because there's a React hook you can use if you want)

<br>

# Why?

### I got bored with conventional solutions (looking at you, Redux). Don't get me wrong, [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a great tool (especially now, ever since [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) is a thing), but setting up global store and making it work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is always a treat...<br>

### Since I don't get to set up fresh redux store very often, I always have to re-learn the docs in order to have the whole thing working the way I like it. Well, not anymore.

### Chipper's API reflects my idea of a perfect (experience may vary 🤷) state-management tool that handles async and TypeScript out of the box with microscopic setup.

<br>

# How?

In the terminal

```javascript
yarn add chipper
// or
npm install chipper
```

In the code

```javascript
import Chipper, { useChip } from "chipper";

Chipper.createQueue([
  ["user", { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }],
  ["theme", { dark: true, color: "pink" }],
]);

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, status, set } = useChip('user');

  set((user) => {
    user.name = 'pooh';
  });

  return (...)
}
```

And that's pretty much it. Congratulations, you just spent 10 seconds setting up your global state. Time well spent, now go, procrastinate some more 🤡

## More elaborate example

```javascript
import Chipper, { useChip } from "chipper";

Chipper.createQueue([
  ["user", { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }],
  ["theme", { dark: true, color: "pink" }]
]);

// for typescript
type User = { uid: string, name: string };
type Theme = { dark: boolean, color: string };
```

```javascript
const MyComponentA = () => {
  const { data, status, set, api } = useChip<User>('user');

  console.log(data); // { uid: "12345", name: "piglet" }
  console.log(status); // { type: "IDLE", message: undefined }

  set((user) => {
    user.name = 'pooh'
  });
  console.log(data); // { uid: "12345", name: "pooh" }
  console.log(status); // { type: "IDLE", message: undefined }

  // or
  set({ uid: "54321", name: "pooh" }, {
    timeout: 2000,
  })
  console.log(data); // after two seconds { uid: "54321", name: "pooh" }
  console.log(status); // after two seconds { type: "SUCCESS", message: undefined }

  // or
  set(someAsyncFunction, {
    onSuccess: (response) => shareGoodNews(to, response),
  })
  console.log(data); // after successfull async { uid: "xxx", name: "xxx" }
  console.log(status); // after successfull async { type: "SUCCESS", message: undefined }

  // or
  api.set<Theme>('whatever you want', 'theme') // aside from TS throwing an error here (mismatched types) it does nothing to MyComponentA, but re-renders MyComponentB (or any other) subscribed to "theme" chip

  return (...)
}
```

```javascript
const MyComponentB = () => {
  const { data, status, set } = useChip<Theme>('theme');

  console.log(data); // { dark: true", color: "pink" }
  console.log(status); // { type: "IDLE", message: undefined }

  // after action taken in MyComponentA

  console.log(data); // 'whatever you want'
  console.log(status); // { type: "IDLE", message: undefined }

  return (...)
}
```

## TODO

### Chipper is ready to use (I wouldn't say it's production ready, but I am going to use it in production when I make sure it doesn't suck). You guys' help would speed things up, if you want to contribute. Todos below are sugary improvements, which would further sweeten our time with this tool:

<br>

- implement developer tools
- unit tests (you're not my real mom! )
- write `useChipper` hook so that we can create new instances of `ChipperOperator` class without having to redo `useChip` logic per singleton.<br>
  **Note**: right now, Chipper is the global singleton that will work with `useChip` hook out of the box. However, creating new instances from `ChipperOperator` class requires retargetting the hook from `Chipper`. At this stage, you can create new singletons but there is no hook to make them reactive. Adding `useChipper` hook later down the road will not introduce breaking changes, or any changes to the API in general
- I could probably strongtype the whole thing a bit better<br>
  **Note**: I know TypeScript, but I am not a TS programmer. I assume there's a way to infer state types based on what we pass to Chipper using `createQueue`, so we don't have to tell the compiler the types explicitly every time we use `useChip`
- add persistance with [storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) and/or [react-native-async-storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)?<br>
  **Note**: react-native-async-storage is kinda heavy, soooo I don't wanna do it, but it'll work with both react and react-native. I will probably add some util function in the docs for folks who might want to have seamless experience with connecting global store and session/local storage
- performance fixes?<br>
  **Note**: I don't really know that much about performance-wise programming yet, but as far as my own testing of Chipper goes, it works, lol 🙈 <br>
  I have never paid much attention to performance between tools - Redux, Context API, Zustand, Jotai - they all perform the same to me. All I care about is dev-ex and neither has fully satisfied my way of coding
- suggestions?
